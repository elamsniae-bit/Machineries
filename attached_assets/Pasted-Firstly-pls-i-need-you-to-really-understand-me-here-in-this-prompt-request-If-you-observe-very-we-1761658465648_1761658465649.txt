Firstly, pls i need you to really understand me here in this prompt/request.
If you observe very well on the whole codebase, you'd see that this project's originally a PHP project, but because the goal's to host it on Netlify (which i've successfully done tho, but needs serious/critical modifications/fixes to the project), had to transition it from PHP to Node.js/Netlify/MongoDB while still keeping the original/normal/default design, UI/UX, features/functions, database e.t.c the same! No changes or recreation anywhere. It's just to transition in terms of programming language/Tech stack while still keeping the originals/defaults the same (no modification anywhere).
So in order for that, it led to the creation of the netlify-build folder which is where we'd basically copy-paste/import everything while refine it from PHP to Node.js/Netlify/MongoDB. So now, the prob's that we didn't import everything like the database, products, product pages e.t.c. While some of the ones we imported successfully, even had issues. So buh firstly, i think am cool with the Home page. Buh basically the rest of the pages that are not still imported and that are even imported needs workings. Like the contact page's missing the navbar and Footer (same for all other pages as well). So pls Fix all of that.

So pls firstly, i'd say you should go back to the original project (PHP), glance properly through every Files and Folders there and then copy-paste/import everything there in the project (netlify-build) properly, accurately and perfectly. No mistakes or errors or incomplete importation pls. EVERYTHING pls. Cos that original PHP project carries a lot that's eventually needed like the database (you know it's complex and broad), e.t.c.

Now after successfully, accurately and perfectly copy-pasted/import EVERYTHING, i'd then need you to do your refining on them ALL. I really do need perfection here pls. Both Front-end, Back-end, database admin, pages, categories and their products, e.t.c. Buh remember, keep the originality pls. Just transition from PHP to Node.js/Netlify/MongoDB.

Now once these are all done, am expected to have EVERYTHING that i do have by default on the PHP and working Perfectly Fine as normal/default on the netlify-build. So pls take your time and do this very sharply. Pls no breaks or disruptions! Just do as i've requested/prompted. Now pls. No breaks anywhere pls. Just do it straight, once and for all. Thanks.
